    DB__MIGRATION_URL lets migrations target a direct, unpooled endpoint. A pooled
    endpoint (e.g. Neon's "-pooler" host running PgBouncer in transaction mode) breaks
    advisory locks and CONCURRENTLY operations, so it is unsafe for migrations; the app
    itself keeps using the pooled DB__URL. Falls back to DB__URL when unset.
